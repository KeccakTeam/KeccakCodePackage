/** General information
  *
  * PlSnP stands for "parallel states and permutations". It is similar to SnP
  * (see SnP-documentation.h), although it specifically provides functions
  * to access an array of states that evolve in parallel.
  *
  * The following functions are not actually implemented. Their documentation
  * is generic, with the prefix PlSnP replaced by
  *  - KeccakP1600times2 for Keccak-p[1600]×2 (i.e., two states of 1600 bits each)
  *  - KeccakP1600times4 for Keccak-p[1600]×4
  *  - KeccakP1600times8 for Keccak-p[1600]×8 (i.e., eight states of 1600 bits each)
  * - Xoodootimes4 for Xoodoo×4 (i.e., four states of 384 bits each)
  * - Xoodootimes8 for Xoodoo×8
  * - Xoodootimes16 for Xoodoo×16 (i.e., sixteen states of 384 bits each)
  * Functions can be replaced by macros, when appropriate.
  *
  * An implementation must provide each function (or macro) as listed below,
  * instantiated with the suitable prefix. In addition, the implementation
  * must come with a header "KeccakP-1600-times{2,4,8}-SnP.h"
  * or "Xoodoo-times{4, 8, 16}-SnP.h"
  * that will be included by the users of the corresponding permutation.

 *   - PlSnP_Feature_Main
 *   - PlSnP_Feature_SpongeAbsorb
 *   - PlSnP_Feature_Farfalle
 *   - PlSnP_Feature_KangarooTwelve

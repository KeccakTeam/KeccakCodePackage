/** General information
  *
  * SnP stands for "state and permutation". It provides a set of function to
  * access and process a state, and in particular to apply a given permutation
  * (or family of permutations) on it.
  *
  * A state is  an array of (width) bits, where the width is the number of input
  * (or output) bits of the permutation. To allow optimizations, the state
  * is represented in an opaque way, and the user must go through the various
  * SnP functions to initialize it, to modify it and to extract data from it.
  *
  * The following functions are not actually implemented. Their documentation
  * is generic, with the prefix SnP replaced by
  *  - KeccakP1600 for Keccak-p[1600]
  *  - Xoodoo for Xoodoo
  * Functions can be replaced by macros, when appropriate.
  *
  * An implementation must provide each function (or macro) as listed below,
  * instantiated with the suitable prefix. In addition, the implementation
  * must come with a header "KeccakP-1600-SnP.h", "Xoodoo-SnP.h", or similar
  * that will be included by the users of the corresponding permutation.
